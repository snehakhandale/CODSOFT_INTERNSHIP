## Advertising Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project is part of Task 4 of my CodSoft internship. The primary objective is to analyze the advertising.csv dataset, which contains data on advertising spends across three different media channels (TV, Radio, and Newspaper) and the corresponding sales figures.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is advertising.csv, which includes the following columns:
TV: Advertising budget allocated to TV (in thousands of dollars)
Radio: Advertising budget allocated to Radio (in thousands of dollars)
Newspaper: Advertising budget allocated to Newspaper (in thousands of dollars)
Sales: Sales figures (in thousands of units)

## Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
1. To explore and visualize the relationships between different advertising channels and sales.
2. To build predictive models that can estimate sales based on the advertising budget.
3. To evaluate the effectiveness of various advertising channels.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for predictive modeling)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advertising-analysis.git
  
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd advertising-analysis

3. Install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts to perform the analysis.

## Results
The results of the analysis, including visualizations and model performance, will be documented in the project's Jupyter notebook.

## Conclusion
This project provides insights into how different advertising budgets impact sales. The findings can help businesses optimize their advertising spend across TV, Radio, and Newspaper channels.
